SQLite and SQLalchemy 

## Overview
The purpose of the project was to use get the descriptive statistics (count, mean, median, mode, max, min etc) of the weather on Hawaii for two months - December and June to understand the viability of opening an ice cream shop on the island.  The data was gathered from weather stations and stored in a sqlite file and was analyzed using python and various modules & packages including sqlAlchemy.

## Results
June Weather
•The descriptive stats for the June temperatures on Hawaii can be viewed: https://github.com/julianadvds/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/June_weather_data.png

•The descriptive stats for the December temperature in Hawaii can be viewed: https://github.com/julianadvds/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Dec_weather_data.png

•The average temperature is about 3 degrees F cooler in December than in June

•There is an 8 degree difference in the minimum temperature between June(64 degree F) and December, there is only a 2 degree temperature difference in maximum from June (85 degrees F) to December (83 degrees F)

•The median temperature in December (71 degrees F) is 4 degrees lower than the median temperature in June (75 degrees F)

## Summary
It is clear from the analysis that the temperature is more favourable in June, with a higher min temp, max temp and median temp than December temperatures.  June also had a smaller standard deviation than the December temperatures indicating less volatile and more consistently warm temperatures. 

To further enhance the analysis to understand how successful an ice cream shop may be, including the total precipitation and number of days experiencing precipitation across both months would provide valuable insights.

In addition, assessing the descriptive stats for both temperature and precipitation for months and showing those on a line chart would help understand annualized trends that would help prepare a new business with things like staffing and inventory.
